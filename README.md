# FLL-UTEP-Scoreboard
(Real World Software) Custom Python software I personally composed and deployed to handle scoring and leaderboards during the official El Paso FIRST® LEGO®  League Explore Festival. This festival was held at UTEP in January 2025 and the software granted logistical support for over 300 students in over 20+ robotics teams.
